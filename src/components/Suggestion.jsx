                    <p className="mt-2">Reducing the amount of waste you produce is the best way to help the environment. According to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), around 18% of the world's CH4 (which absorbs 25 times more solar radiations than CO2) emissions ranging from 9 to 70 mega tonnes annually is generated from landfills. Reducing waste directly and indirectly helps in the carbon footprint reduction. There are lots of ways to do this. For example:</p>
                    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-4">
                        <li className="mt-2">Buy products having less packaging or are packed in materials that don't require a lot of energy or resources to be produced and made up of recyclable material/s.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Don't buy something you're not going to use very often</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Turn down the use of plastic bags, less trash would fill the landfills.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Reduce paper wastage by using electronic medium for paying bills, mails, greeting cards and other communications.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Carry a strong reusable shopping bag and turn down plastic bags thereby to reduce waste to landfill.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                   <h2  className="text-xl font-bold"> Recycling</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">Recycling conserves both raw materials and energy and reduces the amount of waste we produce. In today's world the importance of recycling is becoming greater of a concern both for the general public and also to the economy. All citizens of globe share the responsibility for the environmentally sound recycling of products at the end of their useful life. You can help the environment by buying products that contain recycled materials.</p>
                    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-4">
                        <li className="mt-2">Many of the things which we use can be recycled like paper, glass, etc. Prefer buying and using things made of recyclable materials. Look for the Mobious loop (Symbol of recyclable) on their labels if they are made from recycled materials.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Recycle your own waste by starting a compost bin. Set aside a place where you can dispose of certain food and plant materials. Over time, the materials will decompose into good natural fertilizer (compost). The compost is good for the plants in your garden or in pots. This way we can reduce the garbage as well as the use of chemical fertilizers which again require energy to be produced.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">In some cities/towns there are special services where, you can desegregate your waste in separate bins outside your home, which is collected and sent for recycling/proper disposal. Use the service if available in your city.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Many of the things we use every day, like paper and plastic grocery bags; plastic, aluminum and soda cans; milk cartons, etc. can be sold to the kabadi store for recycling to create new products out of the materials from the old ones.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Do not discard electronic waste unless it is repairable appropriately.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="mt-2">Instead of throwing things away, try to find ways to use them again! The concept of reusing is undoubtedly economic and eco-friendly. Reusing things would in a straight line decrease waste production and manufacturing demands, the processing of which increases carbon footprints. Some of the simple ways to reuse everyday items are mentioned below:</p>
                    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-4">
                        <li className="mt-2">Carry cloth bags for shopping instead of asking for new paper or plastic bags.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Reuse plastic bags as much as possible.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Carry a water bottle while travelling instead of buying packaged water every time.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Use waste paper boxes, cans etc to create attractive decorative material instead of buying new ones. You can also gift these handmade materials.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Don't throw away clothes, toys, furniture and other things that you don't want anymore. Somebody else can probably use them. You can bring them to a center that collects donations, give them to friends, or even have a society sale.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Use all writing paper on both sides.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Reuse all envelopes which you receive.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Use stainless steel kitchenware and dishes instead of disposable plastic utensils and plates.</li>
                    </ul>

                   <h2  className="text-xl font-bold">Save electricity</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">We use electricity everyday at home, at school, at work as an inevitable part of our life. By saving electricity, you are helping to save the world's energy resources like coal, gas, oil and water and you're also saving money. There are a number of things that can be done at home to save energy like,</p>
                    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-4">
                        <li className="mt-2">Replace incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lights (CFL) or light-emitting diodes (LED). CFLs cost three to five times what traditional bulbs do, but consume less than a third of the power. This way household emissions can be reduced by about three hundred kilograms per year.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Switching off lights/fans and appliances not in use would save 10-40% of power.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Save electricity by turning off the electronic gadgets like computers, televisions, DVD players, mobile chargers etc. without keeping them on standby mode.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Make minimal use of air conditioners. Use sleep mode in your AC and set the temperature above 24°C. This could save thousands of tonnes of CO2.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Don't open the refrigerator door more than 45° angle and don't leave fridge doors open for long.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">If you are using geysers or emersion rods, make sure you heat water to the minimum required and use immediately.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Buy energy efficient products. Look for BEE star label (5 star rating).</li>
                    </ul>

                   <h2  className="text-xl font-bold">Save fuel</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">India spends maximum of its foreign earnings on importing crude oil for meeting its growing energy demand. On the other hand, Global warming is the looming concern today. CO2 is the largest contributor to the phenomenon of global warming and petroleum products are the largest source of CO2 emission into the environment. CO2 cannot be stopped being emitted from burning of petroleum products, but it certainly can be reduced to a great extent by way of efficient utilization of these products and by adopting following practices:</p>
                    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-4">
                        <li className="mt-2">Pay your bills online. So you can save fuel by not travelling to actual location physically.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Minimize transportation as fewer vehicles on the road would mean less CO2 emissions.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Walk or cycle to travel short distance, use bike instead of car and use public transport bus or train as much as you can.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Use an electric car/bike which emits less CO2 whenever possible.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Maintain recommended tire pressure in personal vehicles for optimal fuel efficiency.</li>
                        <li className="mt-2">Even while driving a car, simple things like switching off the ignitions at signals, not operating the air conditioner in monsoons, regular servicing of the vehicle, would help to reduce CO2 emissions.</li>
